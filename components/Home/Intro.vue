      a web developer, videographer, photographer, video editor, and network manager from Davao City,
      Philippines. I create web applications and sites using JavaScript, Laravel, Vue, &amp; Node. After years of
      procrastination, Iâ€™ve finally built this website a personal space to share my quirky experiments, creative
      projects, and thoughts, mostly about tech and design.
