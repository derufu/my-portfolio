 I'm Delf Boston a web developer, videographer, photographer, video editor, and network manager from Davao City, Philippines. I create web applications and sites using JavaScript, Laravel, Vue, & Node. After years of procrastination, Iâ€™ve finally built this website a personal space to share my quirky experiments, creative projects, and thoughts, mostly about tech and design.
